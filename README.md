- Associated data
  - ?_morphology.csv: All subject morphological data (depth, thickness)for each sulcal label in each hemisphere in long format for each sample.
  - ?_Depth.csv: Sulcal depth and behavioral data in wide format for each sample
  - ? thick.csv : cortical thickness and behavioral data in wide format for each sample
  - Plots/  model predictions are saved as .csv files in this dir for later use/plotting in R etc.
